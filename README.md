# Modeling of the system of particles.
Here is my starting project for molecular modeling.

- Main idea is to simulate endless system of particles, which interact with each other by LJ potential:
$$
U(\vec{r})=4\varepsilon(\left(\dfrac{\sigma}{r}\right)^12 - \left(\dfrac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6)
$$

- 'Endlessness' of the system will be achieved by periodic boundary conditions
